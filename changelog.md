### Version 1.4

* Fixed and improved the position handling of the **Main HUD** when modified through `client_config.toml`.
* Balanced maximum weights and general weight values to feel more **realistic** (KG).
* **New Lore System**: Item weight now appears as lore text. Stacks are properly summed, and for backpacks, both **base** and **total** weight are shown.
